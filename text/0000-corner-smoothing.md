# Corner Smoothing

## Summary

<!-- TODO: SVG image with regular and smooth rounded corners, as well as overlapping outlines inbetween them. -->

Add a corner smoothing procedure to Blink's Paint phase, controlled by a new CSS property.

The goal of this proposal is to make smooth corners simple, performant, and customizable for Electron app developers.

## Motivation

Integrating with the operating system and its design language is an important aspect of desktop application design.

macOS is well known for its use of smooth round corners. macOS desktop applications that use similar smooth corners in their shapes, even when they deviate from the system controls' designs in other ways, are more harmonious with the system.

The difference can be subtle to many people, but it holds back Electron apps from fully immersing into the system and fitting in with native apps.

<!-- TODO: example image of same Electron app with and without corner smoothing. -->

## Guide-level explanation

### Background: What is Corner Smoothing?

<!-- TODO: remove this section -->

Applying `border-radius` to an element gives it round corners.

```css
.box {
  border-radius: 12px;
}
```
<!-- TODO: example SVG image for above CSS -->

This shape is constructed by placing a circle at each corner inside the box and removing the area outside the circle.

<!-- TODO: example SVG image of a box corner with a circle inside it -->

Looking at one corner, we can see this shape has 3 distinct parts: a straight line from one side of the box, a quarter circle for the corner, and another straight line for the other side of the box.

<!-- TODO: exampel SVG image of the path of a simple rounded corner's 3 parts in different colors -->

Imagine a car driving on this path. As it goes along the straight path, the steering wheel is exactly neutral.

<!-- TODO: example SVG image of a car going along the straight path and a steering wheel illustration perfectly neutral -->

When the car reaches the quarter circle, the steering wheel instantly turns to an angle. It stays at this same angle for the entire turn.

<!-- TODO: example SVG image of a car going along the quarter circle path and a steering wheel illustration at a slight angle -->

Once the car finishes the turn, the steering wheel instantly returns to neutral.

<!-- TODO: example SVG image of a car going along the other straight path and a steering wheel illustration perfectly neutral -->

### CSS property: `-electron-corner-smoothing`

For an element that has the `border-radius` property applied, smooths the round corners by extending the curve along the element's edge.

**Example**:

```css
.round-rect {
  border-radius: 32px;
  -electron-corner-smoothing: 100%;
}
```
<!-- TODO: example SVG image of CSS above -->

* **Value**: The percentage value denotes how far the corner curve can extend, in terms of the radius. At `100%`, the curve will extend the same length as the radius.

  * **Initial value**: `0%`

* **Formal syntax**: `-electron-corner-smoothing = <percentage>`

<!--
Explain the feature as if it were already implemented in Electron and you were teaching it to
an Electron app developer.

This section should:

- Introduce new named concepts.
- Show concrete examples of how the feature is used.
- Explain how the feature will impact existing use cases of Electron.
- If applicable, describe the migration path from an older set of Electron features or APIs.
- Discuss how this impacts the ability to read, understand, and maintain Electron code. Will the
  proposed feature make Electron code more maintainable? How difficult is the upgrade path for
  existing apps?

When writing this section, make sure to clearly account for API differences or considerations for
Windows, macOS, and Linux.

This CSS property is prefixed with `-electron-` to clearly indicate that it is an Electron-specific extension.

## Reference-level explanation

### Smoothing Procedure

The procedure for smoothing the roundness of a corner is based on research in the article [*Desparately seeking squircles* by Daniel Furse, published on the Figma blog](https://www.figma.com/blog/desperately-seeking-squircles/).

In plain terms, we're taking the points where the sides connect to the corner circle and pulling them back into the side:

<!-- TODO: SVG diagram showing simple rounding, highlighting connection points and arrows pulling them back -->

Instead of constructing a round corner with a quarter circle, we will be constructing two cubic B√©zier curves.

<!-- TODO: SVG diagram showing new construction with 2 curves -->

This procedure takes two input parameters: a radius and a length. The radius controls how far in to round the corner. The length controls how far along the side to extend the curve.

From those two inputs, we can calculate the remaining values to construct the 

This procedure satisfies two mathematical constraits:

* The curvature at the point where the side ends and the curve starts is zero. This ensures the transition from the side to the curve is smooth.
* The position and curvature of the "corner" point are the same.

This procedure does not produce mathematically continuous curvature, but the effect is much the same.

### CSS Property Implementation

<!-- TODO: something in blink -->

### Blink Paint Procedure Patch

<!-- TODO -->

### Interactions & Corner Cases

*(Haha, corner cases.)*

<!-- TODO: elliptical corners -->
<!-- TODO -->

Prototype: https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/clavin/smooth-corner-rounding

<!--
This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.
- Any new dependencies on Chromium code are outlined.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how
the detailed proposal makes those examples work.
-->

#### üß† Brainstorm: ‚õàÔ∏è
- Medium complexity patch
- Blink paint phase modified to understand smoothing
- CSS property addition
  - Plumbing property to Blink paint phase

## Drawbacks

### New Territory

Electron does not often features to the Web, and adding a CSS property for a visual modification is new territory for the project.

<!-- When has Electron added Web features? -->

### Overlap with Web Standards

<!-- TODO: perhaps this is better addressed by exsiting web standards bodies -->

<!-- Why should we¬†*not*¬†do this? -->

## Rationale and alternatives

<!--
- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
- If this is an API proposal, could this be done as a JavaScript module or a native Node.js add-on
  instead? Does the proposed change make Electron code easier or harder to read, understand,
  and maintain?
-->

#### üß† Brainstorm: ‚õàÔ∏è
- Alternative: CSS Houdini APIs + image masking
  - Horrifically inefficient and noisy code changes
- Alternative: Web standards proposal
  - Less applicable use case
- Add a WebContents option controlling this feature, default off
  - Potentially avoid fingerprinting
- Alternative approach: superellipses

## Prior art

<!--
Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A few examples of what
this can include are:

- Does this feature exist in other frameworks and what experience have their community had?
- Does this feature exist as a userland implementation, and what can be learned from it?
- Is this related to a change upstream in Chromium or Node.js?
- Does this proposal help Electron further align with evolving web standards?

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from prior
implementations to provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture. If there is no prior art,
that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an
adaptation from other technologies.
-->

#### üß† Brainstorm: ‚õàÔ∏è
- Figma corner smoothing blog post
- iOS & macOS design
- CSS-wise, `-webkit-app-region` in Electron's early days
- CSS Borders Level 4 Draft Issue: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10653

## Unresolved questions

<!--
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature
  before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the
  future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
-->

#### üß† Brainstorm: ‚õàÔ∏è
- Out of scope: Committing to a specific rounding strategy or algorithm
- Elliptical `border-radius` values

## Future possibilities

### Web Standardization

<!-- TODO -->

<!--
Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would
affect the project as a whole in a holistic way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully
consider all possible interactions with the project in your proposal.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but
otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities, you may simply state that you
cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future possibilities section is not a reason to
accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be in the section on motivation or
rationale in this or subsequent RFCs. The section merely provides additional information.
